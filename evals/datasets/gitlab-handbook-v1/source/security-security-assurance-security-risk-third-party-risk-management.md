## GitLab's Integrated Third-Party Risk Management Program

GitLab maintains an industry-leading Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) Program through the use of automation, continuous monitoring, and deep integration across business functions to validate the security of GitLab data shared with external parties.

The integration of GitLab's TPRM program within the vendor Procurement flow enables cross-functional [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration) between Privacy, Legal, IT, and People Operations to facilitate [transparent](/handbook/values/#transparency), risk-based decision-making, Business and Stakeholder-focused [Results](/handbook/values/#results), and adherence to GitLab's Regulatory and [Compliance Obligations](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/certifications/). The vendor relationships maintained through this program are leveraged to create efficiencies across the organization.

## Scope

This procedure applies to all third-party providers that access, store, process or transmit GitLab data.

## Purpose

GitLab's Security Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) Program helps guard against security threats posed by third parties who have access to GitLab data or that of our customers. These risks may include data breaches, unauthorized use or disclosure, and corruption or loss of data. Adequate TPRM is a best practice that helps [mitigate security concerns](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/mitigating-concerns/#security-breach) and enables GitLab to meet our contractual obligations. TPRM also enables GitLab to meet regulatory requirements and standards related to ISO, SOX, GDPR and other state and federal laws requiring vendor oversight.

GitLab's Security TPRM program involves three components which are integrated into our [Procurement](/handbook/finance/procurement/) processes:

1. Performing due diligence to ensure the third party implements safeguards to enforce data privacy and security
   - This activity is performed via our Security Assessment Process. You can find an open source version of our TPRM Assessment Report template in our [Open Source Security Hub](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-security-oss/risk-mgmt/tprm-templates).
1. [Contractually](/handbook/finance/procurement/#3-contracting) obligating the third party to implement these safeguards
1. Monitoring third party safeguards and compliance with these contracted provisions
   - Certain high risk Third Parties are reviewed annually while those posing lower risk are reviewed at intervals defined further within this document.

| _What is the purpose of TPRM?_                            | Our procedures exist to support informed business decisions and mitigate exposure to the ever-evolving threat landscape. This is critical to maintain customer trust and prevent unauthorized data exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| _What is my role?_                                        | Your primary role as a requestor is to help us understand what is being purchased and what data is shared. This helps us complete an accurate assessment efficiently to support your needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| _You reviewed them last year, why are we doing it again?_ | Our assessments are valid for 12 months. After that, a new assessment is required before we can approve additional requisitions. A vendor's security environment and our compliance obligations are subject to change, thus continued oversight is necessary to stay aligned with evolving risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| _Can you just approve and assess after?_                  | No. Introducing new vendors and systems prior to review can expose us to unforeseen security risks and compliance issues. If a request **must** proceed to address a critical business or customer need, approval may be granted via our [Security Notice process](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#tprm-security-notice-process).                                                                                                                      |
| _Can this be expedited?_                                  | Our team can prioritize reviews within reason if a requisition is critical and time-sensitive, however the **best** way to expedite a review is to encourage the vendor to respond to our inquiries quickly. Urgent requests should be escalated to @Security-Risk in the #Procurement channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| _How can I track review status?_                          | Updates will be provided via comments within the Zip requisition. Status updates may be requested there or within the #Procurement channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| _What if they fail the review?_                           | A [Security Notice](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#tprm-security-notice-process) will be opened to communicate deficiencies to relevant stakeholders and determine next steps to support the business need. New vendors that fail our TPRM review may be required to address any identified deficiencies before proceeding. For existing vendors, a remediation plan or offboarding plan may be required depending on the severity of the deficiency. |
| _What triggers a TPRM Assessment?_                        | Funny you should ask...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## What Triggers a TPRM Assessment?

Security Risk monitors various inputs to maintain compliance and ensure proper oversight. TPRM assessments are typically valid for 12 months unless otherwise specified, and are triggered in the following scenarios:

- **New Vendor Engagement:** New vendors or systems accessing [Orange or Red data](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/security/policies_and_standards/standards/data_classification/) require a TPRM review prior to approval.
- **Vendor Renewal:** Vendor renewals may require a TPRM assessment prior to approval if the most recent assessment has expired.
- **Changes in Services:** New services and functionality from existing vendors may introduce risks not covered by previous assessments.
- **Security Incidents:** An assessment may be triggered, along with a [Technical Security Validation](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#technical-security-validations), if a vendor suffers a security incident potentially impacting GitLab data.
- **System Integrations:** Integrations between new or existing systems, especially those processing higher-sensitivity data, may require an assessment. See **[System Integrations](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#third-party-application-integrations)** for details.
- **Annual High-Risk Reviews:** Vendors in-scope for compliance testing (SOC 2, SOX, etc.), [GitLab Sub-Processors](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/subprocessors/), and vendors otherwise processing Red data are reviewed annually to meet compliance obligations.

## Security Considerations for Vendor Selection

Security is a top priority in GitLab's vendor selection process, and GitLab is committed to partnering with vendors who prioritize the protection of sensitive data and maintain robust security measures. As such, Security Risk thoroughly evaluates each vendor's security practices, including their adherence to industry standards, compliance with relevant regulations, and health of their Bitsight security ratings. GitLab's aim is to establish partnerships with vendors who share our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security to safeguard GitLab's data and uphold the trust of our stakeholders. Below are some examples of how Security Risk evaluates vendors of different types and some recommendations for vetting vendors when making purchasing decisions.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Software as a Service (SaaS)</summary>

When considering new software to address business needs and objectives, see below for some high level recommendations to leverage when evaluating the software's capabilities.

- Does the vendor support Single Sign-On (SSO) to enable Team Members to authenticate using their network credentials?
  - Security requires that software has the ability to integrate with Okta for authentication.
- Does the vendor complete an annual independent third party audit of their security controls to show adherence to industry standards and best practices?
  - Security requires software vendors complete and share an annual independent third party audit of their security controls. Some examples of these are a [SOC 2 or ISO 27001 certification](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#acceptable-third-party-attestations).
- Does the vendor incorporate Secure by Design principles throughout the software development lifecycle?
  - Security requires that software vendors perform predeployment threat modeling, vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices during design and development phases of the software.
- Does the vendor require an independent third party penetration test of their systems to identify and remediate vulnerabilities and weaknesses?
  - Security requires that vendors conduct annual independent penetration testing on all systems supporting their SaaS solution and attest to the remediation or mitigation of any high or critical findings posing a material threat to GitLab data.

_Note: Proof of concept (Poc) and pilot software engagements may require the exchange of sensitive GitLab data and must adhere to the same evaluation of the vendor's security practices for new software requests. Security Risk recommends anonymizing sensitive GitLab data and ensuring contract language defines expectations and requirements around data security, [privacy considerations](/handbook/legal/privacy/), and [deletion of data](/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-guidelines/vendor-agreement/#7-termination) after the PoC or pilot is complete._

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Professional Services</summary>

GitLab has an obligation to ensure that all individuals accessing Orange or Red data are subject to sufficient endpoint controls, either by issuing a GitLab-managed device or by performing a TPRM review to ensure appropriate endpoint security controls are in place. Professional services firms are often able to provide sufficient documentation of their security environment, as such we can rely on their endpoints once sufficient assurance is obtained. Independent contractors and firms without sufficiently documented endpoint controls will be provided GitLab-managed endpoints by IT.

See below for high level recommendations to leverage when evaluating professional services vendors.

- Will GitLab documents be shared with the vendor?
  - Security recommends using GitLab's Google Drive to share sensitive data with external parties.
- Does the professional services vendor adhere to strict human resource security practices including acceptable use and data protection training, background screenings, and regular security awareness trainings?
  - GitLab requires professional service vendors have background screenings and security awareness training. Certain background screenings can be facilitated [by GitLab](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#background-screenings) with the vendor's permission. Additionally, if the vendor lacks a security awareness training, propose that they incorporate the [free security awareness training](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/training/v4/Top+tips/Web+package/content/index.html#/) from the [UK's National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/ncsc-cyber-security-training-for-staff-now-available).
- Does the vendor perform work from personal devices?
  - Security requires that GitLab data is protected by adequate endpoint security controls.

### TPRM Assessment Requirements

The following table defines the procedures followed by TPRM engineers for vendors accessing or being transmitted different [classifications of GitLab data](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/security/policies_and_standards/standards/data_classification/). The below procedures are initiated during the [Procurement](/handbook/finance/procurement/#the-procurement-process) process and are followed in all instances where applicable vendors have not been reviewed within the approval windows defined below. **Misalignment with [TPRM's Minimum Security Standards](#third-party-minimum-security-standards) may result in denial of a vendor requisition or issuance of a Security Notice.** If a Security Notice was documented at the time of the previous assessment, inquiry will be performed prior to requisition approval to determine the current status of the identified deficiencies. Depending on the nature of the deficiency, a new TPRM assessment may be required. Any updates will be documented within the Security Notice Issue.

### Determining Vendor Inherent and Residual Risk

TPRM procedures are guided by the vendor's Inherent and Residual Risk levels, which are determined based on the services provided and the nature of data shared. An understanding of these risks is crucial in making an informed business decision for leveraging a vendor.

**Inherent Risk** is the vendor's baseline risk level before accounting for mitigating controls required by GitLab's Third Party Risk Management Program. GitLab uses the [sensitivity of the data exchanged with the vendor](/handbook/security/policies_and_standards/data-classification-standard/#data-classification-levels) to establish the baseline risk level, which dictates our [TPRM assessment requirements](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#tprm-assessment-requirements)

| Inherent Risk Level |   Data Classification   |
| :-----------------: | :---------------------: |
|      Critical       |           Red           |
|        High         | Orange SaaS<sup>1</sup> |
|       Medium        |   Orange<sup>2</sup>    |
|         Low         |     Yellow / Green      |

<ol>
  <li> <i> Due to increased risk with vendor engagements providing cloud services (such as SaaS offerings), the inherent risk level has been elevated to account for emerging threats and vulnerabilities associated with these types of services. </i> </li>
  <li><i>Orange Individual-Use Software is assessed as medium inherent risk under a reduced scope due to the decreased risk associated with these types of requests. See <a href="/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#individual-use-software-requests">here</a> for further guidance.</i></li>
</ol>

**Residual Risk** is the level of risk that remains after accounting for mitigating controls required by GitLab's Third Party Risk Management Program. Effectively managing vendor residual risk requires a balanced approach that considers the criticality of the vendor's services or products, the sensitivity of the data involved, and GitLab's risk tolerance.

Vendors that meet GitLab's security requirements will have residual risks levels as follows:

| Inherent Risk Level | Residual Risk Level |
| :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
|      Critical       |        High         |
|        High         |       Medium        |
|       Medium        |         Low         |
|         Low         |         Low         |

Vendors that fail to meet GitLab's Third Party Risk Assessment requirements will require a [Security Notice.](#tprm-security-notice-process)

## Third Party Minimum Security Standards

TPRM utilizes a risk-based approach when assessing third parties. Specific procedures used to assess different vendor types / risk profiles can be found within the [TPRM Assessment Requirements](#tprm-assessment-requirements) section above.

The Security Risk Team will take reasonable steps to collaborate with vendors and obtain the documentation necessary to complete our review. Depending on the service provided and the data being transmitted, this may include requests for a Third Party Security Attestation and other relevant documentation such as a penetration testing summary. In the event that a vendor does not maintain this documentation, or refuses to provide it, the Security Risk team may deny the request or require completion of a [TPRM Security Notice](#tprm-security-notice-process) prior to approval.

Deficiencies commonly identified during our TPRM procedures are listed below:

1. Lack of third-party Security attestation such as an ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type 2
1. Lack of background checks for employees and contractors
1. Inability to integrate with [Okta](/handbook/eta/corporate-it/end-user-services/okta/#what-is-okta)* (in alignment with [GitLab's Password Standard](/handbook/security/policies_and_standards/password-standard/#application-authentication-requirements))
   - If the Okta integration is not in place or not possible, native multi-factor authentication (MFA) capabilities can be a mitigating control. This should be escalated to CorpSec for sign-off prior to approving the associated requisition.
1. Systems lacking evidence of a recent penetration test
1. Unresolved High and/or Critical penetration testing findings with no apparent remediation plan or expected remediation date
   - Penetration testing findings are reviewed by the engineer to understand the nature of the deficiency and their impact to GitLab. Deficiencies found to present a negligible impact to GitLab or that are sufficiently mitigated by existing GitLab controls may not result in an adverse conclusion.

Deficiencies identified are reviewed in the context of the vendor's greater Security environment and the data transmitted. If a material risk to GitLab data is identified, this will be reported to the Business Owner via the [TPRM Security Notice Process](#tprm-security-notice-process).

### Acceptable Third-Party Attestations

GitLab obtains and reviews third-party attestations to provide assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of a service provider's internal control environment. These attestations commonly include, but are not limited to, an ISO 27001 certificate or a Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type 2 report. Alternate forms of attestations can be leveraged in the absence of these more common documents, though diligence should be performed by the assessor in determining whether the attestation provides sufficient coverage over the control environment and aligns with our assessment criteria.

**ISO 27001:** An ISO 27001 certificate with the accompanying [Information Security Management System (ISMS)](/handbook/security/isms/) scope and [Statement of Applicability (SoA)](https://www.isms.online/iso-27001/iso27001-statement-applicability-simplified/) can be leveraged as evidence of compliance with industry-standard security best practices. The ISMS scope helps ensure that the services provided by the vendor to GitLab are covered by the ISO audit, and the SoA provides visibility into the policies and controls that are applied by the organization. A valid ISO 27001 certificate providing coverage over applicable services indicates that an external certifying body has performed testing to validate the design and operating effectiveness of controls related to the management team's continued performance of the following:

- Systematic examination of the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;
- Design and implementation of a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and
- Adoption of an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001#:~:text=2020.%5B5%5D-,How%20the%20standard%20works,-%5Bedit%5D))

In the event that a vendor provides a valid ISO 27001 certificate but is unable to provide their SoA, we require the completion of a self-attestation such as a SIG or CAIQ to meet our assessment criteria and gain a better understanding of their security environment.

_Be aware that ISO 27001 certificates include an expiration date. Once this date has passed, the certificate is no longer valid and should not be leveraged in our assessment._

**SOC 2 Type 2:** The SOC 2 Type 2 report is the preferred attestation when assessing third party risk, as this report details the design of an organization's information system and how various forms of risk are addressed. This report not only details the controls in place within an organization, but it also includes independent validation of whether or not each of those controls functioned effectively during the audit period. This report should be reviewed to validate the following:

- The report provides coverage over the service being provided to GitLab;
- The report was issued within the last 12 months;
  - If the most recent report is older than 12 months, a Bridge Letter should be obtained to provide assurance that material changes have not occurred to the vendor's control environment since the report's issuance.
- The report is issued without a qualified opinion or exceptions otherwise impacting the security of GitLab data.
  - A report designated as "qualified" indicates that one or more controls assessed were found to be inadequately designed or implemented during the audit period. The nature of the qualification should be reviewed and understood to determine whether the control failure could impact the security of GitLab data, and if so should be reported to the Business Owner via TPRM Security Notice.
  - Exceptions may be identified within the report that do not result in the issuance of a qualified opinion, though any exceptions should still be reviewed for the following to determine if they may present a risk to GitLab data:
    - **Nature of the Exception:** The related control and the exception itself should be reviewed to determine whether GitLab relies upon that control to safeguard our data.
    - **Management's Response:** A management response is often included to address the reason for the exception and any steps that have been taken to address and remediate it. This may be accompanied by re-testing performed by the external auditor to validate that remediation was successful.
  - These items, if present, should be noted within the TPRM Assessment Report. If the nature of the qualification or exception is found to impact GitLab's security, and management's response provides insufficient assurance that remediation steps have been taken, this should be reported to the Business Owner via the TPRM Security Notice Process.

**SOC 2 Type 1:** The SOC 2 Type 1 report is often published as part of a preliminary assessment during the SOC 2 Type 2 "readiness" process. This is a limited scope, point in time assessment of the design of controls in place within a service provider's environment, and **does not include a validation of control operating effectiveness. As such, the Type 1 report should not be leveraged on its own to address our third-party attestation requirements for Orange SaaS / Red systems**, however it may be leveraged in addition to an ISO 27001 certificate or equivalent attestation in providing assurance over a service provider's environment.

**PCI Attestation of Compliance:** A [PCI Attestation of Compliance (AoC)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/glossary/aoc/) is leveraged by the [Security Compliance Team](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/) to validate a service provider's compliance with the PCI DSS framework. This attestation, along with the accompanying Responsibility Matrix, is commonly required for vendors hosting GitLab infrastructure. The Security Risk team gathers this documentation when necessary upon request by Security Compliance. PCI AoCs are **not leveraged by Security Risk to meet [TPRM Assessment Requirements](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#tprm-assessment-requirements)**.

#### Complementary User Entity Controls (CUECs)

Some vendor's control objectives cannot be met without proper design and implementation of supporting controls by GitLab, which are specified in the form of Complementary User Entity Controls (CUECs) within a vendor's SOC 2 report. CUECs are commonly leveraged by vendors to support data security and service commitments, and it is GitLab's responsibility to address these controls to support data security and prevent unauthorized data disclosure.

The Security Risk team obtains vendor SOC 2 reports during our reviews and determines whether CUECs are defined and relied upon by the vendor. If CUECs are defined, the Business Owner will be notified upon approval of the Zip requisition and instructed to review the CUECs and ensure controls are in place to address them. If controls are not already in place, the Business Owner is responsible for coordinating the implementation of these controls. This can be completed in collaboration with the Security Assurance team. We recommend creating an epic in your primary GitLab project titled `Application/Service Name CUEC Mapping`. An issue should be created for each CUEC that requires action. Issues would be closed once a documented plan or process is in place, ideally in the Handbook, including a mechanism for ensuring the controls take place periodically if needed. Common CUECs and guidance for each can be found in the table below. Note that the specific language defined in the vendor's SOC report may differ from the language below and may require a modified course of action.

### Standard Information Gathering (SIG) Questionnaire for Vendor Self Attestation

A self-attestation such as a [SIG questionnaire](https://sharedassessments.org/sig/), or equivalent document such as a CAIQ, is required if an individual-use software vendor is unable to provide a valid SOC 2 Type 2 report or an ISO 27001 certificate along with its Statement of Applicability. Red vendors or Orange SaaS vendors are required to provide a Third-Party Attestation as defined above. The SIG questionnaire is reviewed alongside the responses to our Security Questionnaire when assessing the maturity of a service organization's Security environment.

Security Risk maintains multiple templated versions of the SIG questionnaire for use depending on the product or service being assessed, as some vendors may not have a SIG questionnaire or equivalent to provide. The SIG templates include instructions noting that we only require Inquiry responses within Columns D and E of the main questionnaire tab, as additional requests for information or documentation within the SIG are generally not required. Note that potential fringe cases _could_ exist wherein professional discretion may dictate the necessity for additional documentation requests to supplement vendor responses. Further, professional discretion should be applied when making decisions as to which version of the SIG questionnaire should be sent. For cases in which the level of review required is unclear, engineers are encouraged to discuss with the @Security-Risk team in the #Sec-Assurance-Team channel to come to a decision considering factors such as the services offered, data exchanged and the outcome of previous assessments.

  - The SIG Lite Plus questionnaire is leveraged most commonly and should be utilized for all Red vendors and Orange SaaS systems. We refer to our SIG Lite as the "SIG Lite Plus" as it includes full scope SIG questionnaires for domains "E. Human Resource Security and V. Cloud Services". All other domains include standard SIG Lite content. Our objective here is to obtain additional information related to cloud security and the use of personal computers and employee background checks.
  - The following 20 domains are included within the scope of the SIG Lite Plus questionnaire:
    - A. Enterprise Risk Management
    - B. Nth Party Management
    - C. Information Assurance
    - D. Asset and Info Management
    - E. Human Resources Security (Full SIG Content)
    - F. Physical and Environmental Security

  - The Professional Services SIG Lite Plus questionnaire features a reduced scope and can be leveraged for scenarios in which an **Orange** vendor is only providing contracted services or services not otherwise resulting in the introduction of a system being transmitted sensitive GitLab data. In these cases it may not be necessary to perform a full-scope review of the vendor's Security environment, as many controls within the full SIG Lite questionnaire may not apply or present a material risk to GitLab data. **Please note this guidance applies only to Orange professional services providers. Service providers being granted access to Red data in the provision of services should be assessed utilizing the SIG Lite Plus questionnaire defined above due to the greater obligation for Data Security with these providers.**
  - The following domains are included within the scope of the Professional Services SIG Lite Plus questionnaire.

{{% details summary="Reviewing SIG Responses" %}}
Vendor responses documented within the SIG questionnaire should be reviewed in the context of the services provided by the vendor, with care taken to understand the broader control environment and how certain control deficiencies may be mitigated by other existing controls. For example, a vendor that does not rely on 3rd party service providers in the provision of services would be unlikely to maintain a Third Party Risk Management program, which is unlikely to pose a risk to GitLab in the broader context of services being provided. Significant deviations such as this should be flagged during the review and noted within the SIG questionnaire with an explanation on why the deficiency does not present a risk to GitLab data. Mitigating controls, if identified, should be defined within these notes as well. Engineers are encouraged to perform follow-up inquiries with vendors as necessary to determine whether a control deficiency exists. These inquiries should be further noted within the SIG document or within the TPRM Assessment Report.

Deficiencies identified that may present a material risk to GitLab data should be noted within the TPRM assessment report and presented to the Business Owner via the TPRM Security Notice Process detailed below.

_SIG questionnaires (or equivalent) provided by a vendor **not** utilizing a GitLab-provided template should be reviewed to ensure they meet our due diligence standards. Domains not sufficiently addressed by a vendor-provided questionnaire should be identified, with additional inquiries performed to gain assurance over all in-scope domains._

### Leveraging Bitsight

Usage of Bitsight provides the Security Risk team with a comprehensive and continuous view of the external security posture of GitLab's vendor ecosystem. Bitsight enables Security Risk to identify and assess potential security risks across our vendors in real-time, allowing us to prioritize our resources and focus on addressing the potentially critical vulnerabilities that could impact GitLab. GitLab leverages Bitsight for continuous monitoring of most critical systems through the process below:

- **Bitsight Daily Alerting**

Bitsight's Daily Alerting is leveraged to establish a system for continuously monitoring the security posture of GitLab's highest criticality vendors to identify and respond to potential risks and vulnerabilities promptly. The use of this service enables Security Risk to maintain a proactive approach to third party security management, operating 24/7 to help safeguard GitLab sensitive data and infrastructure effectively. Changes in GitLab's Tier 1 vendor's environments could lead to further security inquiries and investigations, a new security review, or TPRM Security Notice, depending on the severity and impact to GitLab.

Assessors should [submit a Company Request](https://help.bitsighttech.com/hc/en-us/articles/231344488-Company-) if a vendor is not present within BitSight at the time of review.

### TPRM Approval Windows

The Security Risk team has established approval windows dictating the lifecycle of our TPRM assessments and their reliance in approving requisitions, after which a new assessment must be completed prior to approval of subsequent requisitions to ensure continued adherence to GitLab's regulatory and due diligence requirements. These windows are defined in alignment with the nature of the requisition, sensitivity of data shared, and the Critical System Tier

| Critical System Tier        | Assessment Scope | Approval Window |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Tier 1 Mission Critical     | Full Scope       | 12 months       |
| Tier 2 Business Critical    | Full Scope       | 12 months       |
| Tier 3 Business Operational | Full Scope       | 24 months       |
| Tier 4 Administrative       | Reduced Scope    | 24 months       |

Professional services providers or vendors otherwise accessing **Red** data are assessed in alignment with our Tier 1 Mission Critical requirements. Providers with access to **Orange** data are assessed in alignment with our Tier 3 Business Operational requirements.

Requisitions must be reviewed to determine whether a scope change has occurred since the previous assessment that could indicate a material change in the data transmitted to the vendor. See the [Material Changes](#material-changes) section for guidance.

#### Material Changes

Material Changes to services provided to GitLab or to a vendor's security environment could present an increased risk that may not have been present at the time of the previous review. As such, requisitions for vendors within the [**Approval Window**](#tprm-approval-windows) of their previous assessment must be reviewed by the TPRM Engineer to determine whether a material change has occurred to the service(s) provided. Examples of these changes include:

1. **Change in data classification**, such as going from Yellow to Orange data classification.
1. **Addition of a new system not in the scope of the previous review.** For example, vendor XYZ was reviewed for procurement of their **Billing** system, but a new request has come in for the purchase of their **Revenue** system.
1. **Change of location where data is stored or transmitted**, such as migrating data from a GitLab-hosted environment to a vendor's SaaS solution.
1. **Addition of new contractors that are not subject to the vendor's security controls**.
1. **Introduction of new AI functionality within a system resulting in the addition of a new sub-processor**.

To determine whether the previous review provides assurance over the new service or system, review the previously-leveraged documentation for coverage or ask the vendor directly. If sufficient assurance does not exist, or the change is believed to introduce additional risk to GitLab, the Security Risk team may need to complete a new TPRM review prior to approving the requisition.

Vendors occasionally implement changes between contracting cycles that could introduce previously unidentified risks, such as the introduction of new AI features and/or [subservice providers](https://www.schellman.com/blog/soc-examinations/subservice-organizations-vs-vendors-within-soc). Team members should [notify the Security Risk team](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/#contact) when these changes occur, and if necessary may be directed not to allow, utilize, or enable such functionality until a new assessment has been completed. Upon notification of such changes, the Security Risk team will follow the above procedures to determine whether a new review is necessary.

**Note:** Circumstances may exist outside of those defined above that could necessitate further review. TPRM Engineers should use professional discretion in identifying these circumstances and perform additional review or validation as needed. Questions or concerns regarding the materiality of a change or the appropriate approval window should be escalated to the Security Risk Team within the #Sec-Assurance-Team channel.

### TPRM Security Notice Process

Deficiencies identified during TPRM and Post-Implementation Controls (PIC) reviews are reported to the Business Owner via a [TPRM Security Notice](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-risk-team/third-party-vendor-security-management/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Security%20Notice%20%20Template) issue. This issue contains (1) background information pertinent to the vendor or requisition, (2) a description of the validations performed by the Security Risk team, and (3) a description of Security deficiencies and resulting risk that may be present to GitLab data shared with the vendor. A "worst case" scenario is included to portray the potential real-world impact of a security incident resulting from the risk. Where possible, TPRM will also include a recommendation for either mitigating or avoiding the identified risk. For deficiencies resulting from a failure in the design or operating effectiveness of a system's Security controls, a [Technical Security Validation](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#technical-security-validations) may be requested prior to stakeholder delivery to provide greater context within the Security Notice. These items are documented in order to support an informed decision by the Business Owner and other relevant parties.

#### Requisition Denial

TPRM may deny requisitions in the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient assurance over a vendor's security environment or if there are deficiencies presenting an active risk to GitLab data or service offerings.

New vendors unable to meet our minimum security requirements may be denied by Security. If you have concerns that a prospective vendor may not meet our requirements please reach out to @securityrisk in Slack.

Existing vendors not meeting our minimum security standards may require documentation of an offboarding plan or a remediation plan agreed upon by the vendor prior to requisition approval. The Security Notice will be routed for approval as documented below.

TPRM does not maintain a listing of denied third parties as their environments are subject to change and may mature to meet our requirements. Previous assessment outcomes are documented and available upon request.

#### Accepting the Risk

Circumstances may arise in which business requirements necessitate moving forward with a vendor. In these scenarios the Business Owner and other relevant stakeholders **may elect to accept the documented risk as not to negatively impact business operations.** Security Risk will provide their opinion regarding whether or not this is warranted based upon the information available. If the Business Owner decides to move forward with the vendor in light of the reported deficiencies, they are responsible for completion of the below items:

1. **Acknowledgement** of the [Accept the Risk](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/#accept-the-risk) section of the StORM handbook page and their understanding of its contents.
1. **Justification** for moving forward with the vendor in light of the identified deficiencies.
1. **Remediation Plan** to address any identified deficiencies. This must be time-bound and include all necessary steps to resolve the Security finding. Failure to remediate the finding prior to the next renewal may result in E-Group escalation.
1. **Annual recertification** in the event that the risk is unremediated. This will trigger a new assessment of the vendor or system along with associated approvals from relevant stakeholders.
1. **Approval** of the Security Notice. In order to promote transparency across the organization, approval will be required by the Business Owner, their VP, IT, and the appropriate E-Group member if deemed necessary by the Security Risk team based on the perceived severity of the deficiency.

In some circumstances, the business may require accelerated approval of a requisition prior to completion of a security review. In these scenarios, a TPRM Security Notice will be documented and presented to the Business Owner and their VP. Failure to obtain the requisite materials within a reasonable timeline following approval may result in escalation of the risk to the E-Group.

### Technical Security Validations

TPRM partners with GitLab's [Security Research team](/handbook/security/product-security/security-platforms-architecture/security-research/) to facilitate [Technical Security Validations (TSVs)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/technical-security-validation/-/issues/new?issue[title]=Technical%20Security%20Validation%20-%20%5BVendor%2FSoftware%20Name%5D&issuable_template=TSV%20Intake%20Template) of higher risk systems such as those affected by deficiencies in the design or operation of their security controls. These validations are triggered during our Security Notice process and include a deeper look into the security configurations of a system and their impact to GitLab. Necessity of a TSV is determined based on the nature of deficiencies identified, nature of data transmitted, and criticality of the system. Areas of concern identified during the TSV process are documented within the TSV issue and integrated into the related Security Notice to provide greater assurance to GitLab and support informed decisions by stakeholders.

Completion of the TSV may be required at TPRMs discretion prior to approval of the associated requisition, depending on factors such as severity of the identified deficiency, sensitivity of data transmitted, and criticality of the system. This approach is taken to facilitate a more informed business decision prior to the introduction or continued presence of data within potentially insecure environments. The Business Owner will be notified of this and can appeal the delay if it may cause a business disruption or lapse in payment to the vendor.

### New System Onboarding & Post-Implementation Controls (PIC)

As an output of our TPRM assessments, the Security Risk team partners with [Information Technology](/handbook/business-technology) to inventory the usage, administration, and integration of new applications supporting various GitLab functions. This inventory lives within the [Tech Stack](https://helplab.gitlab.systems/esc?id=gitlab_cmdb_applications), GitLab's [single source of truth (SSOT)](/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth) for technology that supports the business. Requirements are defined in alignment with each system's Critical System Tier. More information on how Critical System Tiering (CST) is leveraged by GitLab can be found within the [CST Handbook page](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/critical-systems/).

#### Post-Implementation Controls (PIC)

The Post-Implementation Controls (PIC) process validates that a new system is configured and deployed effectively and securely within GitLab's environment after go-live. Security Risk initiates a PIC issue and assigns it to the Business Owner, who is responsible for completing and attesting to the following control domains:

- **CUECs** — Acknowledgment of any Complementary User Entity Controls from the vendor's SOC 2 report, using GitLab-specific translations provided by Security Risk.
- **Access Security** — Confirmation that local authentication is disabled, service accounts are inventoried, and user access is provisioned through Okta SSO with a deprovisioning process in place.
- **Infrastructure Security** — For CST 1 and CST 2 systems, confirmation that vendor logs are ingested by the SIEM and monitoring is in place.
- **Business Continuity** — Acknowledgment that the system's RTO/RPO requirements are understood and the vendor is incorporated into incident response workflows where applicable.
- **Application Integrations** — Documentation of any API connections established at go-live and confirmation that API keys are managed per GitLab policy.
- **Compliance Scope** — Acknowledgment of any compliance obligations associated with the system.

Completed PIC issues are linked to the vendor's [Tech Stack](https://helplab.gitlab.systems/esc?id=gitlab_cmdb_applications) record. Questions can be directed to @security-risk in the #security_help channel.

Where a control domain identifies a deficiency against GitLab's requirements and no compensating control is present, Security Risk opens a [TPRM Security Notice](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-risk-team/third-party-vendor-security-management/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Security%20Notice%20%20Template) for the Business Owner's sign-off, following the [TPRM Security Notice Process](#tprm-security-notice-process).

### Other Types of Third Party Assessments

#### Annual High-Risk Vendor Assessments

GitLab places particular reliance on a subset of vendors that either have access to Red data or are in scope for compliance activities. With this in mind, Security Risk follows an annual assessment cadence for these vendors to ensure ongoing coverage and identification of potential security risks. These assessments take place during Q4 of each Fiscal Year.

Scoping for this activity is based on the below populations, and is finalized in coordination with various teams within GitLab to ensure accuracy in our scoping:

1. [GitLab's Third Party Sub-Processors](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/subprocessors/#third-party-sub-processors)
1. [Red Professional Services Sub-Processors](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/subprocessors/#professional-services-sub-processors)
1. SOC 2-scoped Applications
1. Red Applications

Vendors within the above populations are assessed in alignment with our Red vendor assessment criteria. Deficiencies identified are reported to Business Owners in alignment with our TPRM Security Notice process.

#### Third Party Application Integrations

Integrations between systems within GitLab's environment are subject to the above-defined TPRM assessment procedures to obtain assurance over the security of data transmitted between each system. The Security Risk team will review the request to obtain an understanding of the data being shared. Application Integration Requests can be opened using the App Integrations issue template located [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issue%5Btitle%5D=%5BSystem%20Name%5D%20Integration%20Request&description_template=application_integration_request).

The Application Integration Request process functions to allow visibility and oversight of systems interacting with each other in support of GitLab. This process also functions as a "soft gate" for the Security Risk team to identify and assess existing systems that are not subject to the standard Zip procurement process. Each system within the integration request is reviewed to determine whether an assessment has previously been completed to address the sensitivity of data being transmitted as a result of the proposed integration. New systems, or integrations resulting in increased sensitivity of data being transmitted to a system, will require a TPRM review be completed prior to approval of the request. If each system listed within the request has been previously assessed at any point in alignment with the data shared in the new integration, the request can be approved prior to additional review.

App Integration Requests are subject to an extended 24 month approval window to support alignment between our TPRM reviews and contract renewals. If the review for either system in question has aged out of its approval window, the request can be approved with a new review of either system being launched and completed afterwards. This is intended to support GitLab's values of Iteration and Results by not delaying integrations that we believe to be of lower risk. If our review criteria have been met, but areas of concern have otherwise been identified, assessors are encouraged to use professional judgment in delaying approval until the items are resolved or a new assessment has been completed. Deficiencies identified as a result of Application Integration Requests are reported to the Business Owner of the related system, which may or may not be the individual that opened the Integration Request.

#### Individual-Use Software Requests

Procedures for requesting individual-use software can be found [here](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/pre-approved-individual-use-software/). These tools are often categorized as having a [Critical System Tier](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/critical-systems) of '4' and are not required to be represented in the [Tech Stack](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack-applications/) due to a lack of centralized ownership.

Orange Individual-Use Software is assessed under a reduced scope in consideration of vendor resourcing and the limited scope of usage within GitLab. See the [TPRM Assessment Requirements](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/#tprm-assessment-requirements) section above for more detail on requirements for these vendors. Assessors are encouraged to perform a full-scope assessment if they feel one is warranted. Security Risk reserves the right to disallow or withhold approval for Individual Use Software that does not meet our security requirements. Exceptions to this process will be considered on a case-by-case basis and reported to relevant stakeholders via the TPRM Security Notice process. For more information, refer to GitLab's [Internal Acceptable Use Policy](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/).

#### Documentation Requests

Looking for compliance reports for an active GitLab vendor? [Open a new issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-risk-team/third-party-vendor-security-management/-/issues/new) within the TPRM workspace using the 'Vendor Documentation Request' template, and we'll be happy to track it down.

### Usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) services by GitLab Team Members carries unique Security, Privacy, and Legal implications and is governed by [GitLab's Acceptable Use Policy](/handbook/legal/acceptable-use-policy/). While TPRM has integrated procedures to gain assurance over the security of AI functionality, we may be unable to make determinations in some scenarios as to whether usage of these services is in alignment with GitLab's AI Acceptable Use Policy. As such, TPRM may engage the Legal and CorpSec teams prior to requisition approval to understand whether the usage of this functionality could result in additional risks. Adverse findings by these teams may result in denial of the requisition by the TPRM Engineer.

### Exceptions to the TPRM Process

In specific instances, requirements for the performance or contents of TPRM reviews may vary from the standard process defined above:

1. For privacy-driven TPRM reviews, instances where GitLab **receives** personal data from a third party in a [Controller-to-Controller](/handbook/legal/privacy/#privacy-terms) transfer do not require a TPRM review. The Privacy team will classify the nature of the relationship as part of the Privacy assessment during the procurement process.
1. Law Firms, Accountants and Auditors may receive data, including Red data, in a [Controller-to-Controller relationship](/handbook/legal/privacy/#privacy-terms), meaning these types of entities have direct obligations and standards for processing data under law. As such, these entities may be treated as Orange vendors.
1. Instances where GitLab Team Members provide their own data to a third-party [Data Controller](/handbook/legal/privacy/#privacy-terms), in which the Team Member personally acknowledges the third-party's terms, may not require a TPRM assessment. Examples may include signing up for health, coaching or counseling benefits where GitLab only finances the service but does not send or receive data on behalf of Team Members and Team Members voluntarily decide to enter the program.
1. Field Marketing events do not require the completion of a Security review as the gathering of contact information for GL Team Members and prospects is considered to be standard for the normal course of business for the Field Marketing team. Note that if the Field Marketing Team is commissioning the use of software to facilitate its operations or have hired a Vendor to collect data on behalf of GitLab, these vendors may be subject to TPRM review as they could be considered a [Data Processor](/handbook/legal/privacy/#privacy-terms)(see 1. above for more information). GitLab receiving event data from another organizer or GitLab sharing event data with other independent organizations and/or sponsors does not require a TPRM assessment.
